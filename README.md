Dr. Sync is HIPAA Compliant Java and C++ Application that receives real-time external sensor data wirelessly and sends to AWS RDS (MySQL database) along with patient information. Data is then organized on a secure web application hosted by Retool. Compatible with ANT+ and/or Bluetooth Sensors including heartrate, temperature, and blood pressure. Application UI designed using Swing.  

Prerequisites:  
Latest Version of Java  
Visual Studio 2013 (or the dll file requested at launch)  

Limitations:  
This contains only the heartrate functionality. However, this can be used as a base template for additional sensors such as heartrate, temperature, and blood pressure. The UI buttons for the extra sensors are already made along with the selection logic in the java program. You will need to download the specific C++ sensor file from the ANT+ SDK API libraries found at https://www.thisisant.com/developer/resources/downloads/#software_tab
